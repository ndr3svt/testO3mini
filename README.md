# Testing o3 mini with coding tasks


## Prompts given


1. write a js program that shows a ball bouncing inside a spinning hexagon. The ball should be affected by gravity and friction, and it must bounce off the rotating walls realistically
2. now make it so that the balls should also collide against each other and affect each other
*NOTE* here the balls get stuck within themselves and pull each other out of the boundaries
3. @index.html looks good, now add some limits so balls cannot scape the boundaries of the polygon, as during the first frames all balls get cluttered and push each other drastically out of the boundaries and collapse to the infinite bottom , only a few manage to stay within the boundaries and behave normally
*NOTE* this doesn't fully correct the issue, although balls are confined to the boundaries of the polygon
4. seems like the balls get stuck with each other just revolting energetically in a cluster, not being able to scape the clump , fix that so balls bounce naturally when colliding with each other and the boundaries of the polygon, also without scaping the polygon @index.html
